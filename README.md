### Theme Cusomizer
Use the theme customizer to customize the theme to taste. There are just enough options to make your site unique. You can change the background color, the header image, the headings text color, the primary menu colors, the top menu colors and even the sidebar links color.

To use the theme's customizer, log in to your dashboard and navigate to Appearance > Customize. You can also access the customizer from the admin bar on the top of the page. 

### Header Options
You can add custom header image and position it any way you want via the header options in the theme customizer. You can also edit the header call to action button on the homepage. By default, this theme ships with a beautiful museum logo. You can remove it and add your own custom logo from the Site Identity section

### Right Sidebar
The theme supports a right sidebar or full-width layout (no sidebar) and you can add as many widgets as you want in the right sidebar, e.g search box, recent posts or tag cloud. You can add a widget from dashboard > appearance > widgets.

### Footer Widgets
In addition to the right sidebar, you can add widgets to two defined regions in the footer. They are named "Footer 1" and "Footer 2". These will be arranged in a beautiful multi-column layout. The theme works best if you add just one widget in Footer 1 and two widgets in Footer 2. In this way, you should have 3 widgets in the footer in total. You can add a footer widget from dashboard > widgets.

### Breadcrumbs
Muzeum has a built-in breadcrumb system for posts and pages. You can choose whether to display or remove the breadcrumbs from the theme customizer.

### Post Meta information
The theme displays post meta information for each post. You can choose whether to show or remove any post meta information (date, author, category, tags and comments).

### Primary Menu
Go to `appearance => menu` and create a menu, then assign it to "Primary" location. This theme supports two menu locations, "Primary" and "Top". If there is no menu assigned to the primary menu location, the primary menu will display a list with all the site's pages. The top menu bar will be hidden until you asssign it to a menu.

### Social Icons Menu
Muzeum theme ships with a beatiful open-source font by the Ionic Team called [ionicons](https://ionicons.com/). In the pro vesrion of the theme, you can add social media icons (facebook, twitter, etc.) to the "Top" menu location directly from the theme customizer.

Navigate to `appearance => customize => social icons` and in the url tab of the social platform url, add the exact link. For example, in the case of facebook link, you can add https://facebook.com/wordpress and the facebook icon will automatically appear in the top menu (do not forget to replace this link with your profile's link)

You can add as many social icons to the top menu, as you wish. For more information, check [ionicons documentation](https://ionicons.com/)
